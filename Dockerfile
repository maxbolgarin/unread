# Generic `unread` CLI container image.
#
# No ENTRYPOINT — the image is a general-purpose `unread` runtime.
# Callers pick what to run:
#
#   # Run the bot (long-running service via compose):
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.bot.yml up -d
#
#   # Run the bot directly (no compose):
#   docker run -d \
#     --name unread-bot \
#     -e TELEGRAM_API_ID=... -e TELEGRAM_API_HASH=... \
#     -e OPENAI_API_KEY=... -e UNREAD_BOT_TOKEN=... \
#     -v unread_state:/root/.unread \
#     ghcr.io/maxbolgarin/unread:latest \
#     unread bot run
#
#   # Ad-hoc CLI invocation:
#   docker run --rm -v unread_state:/root/.unread \
#     ghcr.io/maxbolgarin/unread:latest \
#     unread doctor
#
# Bare `docker run …/unread` prints `unread --help` (see CMD below).

FROM python:3.11-slim AS base

# System deps:
# - ffmpeg: audio/video transcoding for Whisper. Without it, the bot
#   can still serve files/URLs/YouTube text but voice/video uploads
#   fail with a friendly "ffmpeg required" message at request time.
# - fonts-*: libpango is the SHAPING ENGINE, not a font. Without real
#   font files a rendered PDF falls back to whatever the base image
#   happens to have — which had no emoji, so a fact-check verdict table
#   showed ✅/❌ as tofu boxes while ⚠️ came through. dejavu covers
#   Latin/Cyrillic text, noto-color-emoji covers the verdict icons.
# - libpango / libpangoft2: backs `weasyprint` for markdown → PDF
#   report rendering. Since v1.x, weasyprint is a base dep (not a
#   `[bot]` extra) so phone Telegram clients get PDF reports out of
#   the box. Operators who want `.md` instead set
#   `UNREAD_BOT_REPORT_FORMAT=md`.
