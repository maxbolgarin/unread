"""Chat-completion orchestration: provider dispatch + retries + logging.

The actual API calls live in `unread.ai.<provider>_provider`. This
module owns the policy that's identical across providers:

  - Single-call → log usage / cost / context fields.
  - On `truncated=True` (output cut at `max_tokens`), retry once with
    a doubled budget, capped at the per-model `max_output_tokens` from
    :mod:`unread.ai.models` (or 16k fallback for unknown models).
  - On :class:`ProviderSafetyBlockedError` (Gemini's safety refusal),
    surface a yellow user-visible status and re-raise — never retry.
  - Re-export :class:`ChatResult` from the canonical `unread.ai`
    module so existing callers that destructure it keep working.

`make_client()` returns the active provider (an alias preserved for
back-compat — call sites pass it to `chat_complete` exactly as they
did when it was an `AsyncOpenAI` instance).

    `web_search` grounds the answer in live web results. Requested only
    by the fact-check preset's verify call, and only when the provider
    advertises `supports_web_search` — adapters without the capability
    ignore it.

    If the provider reports `truncated=True` on the first call, retry
    once with `max_tokens` doubled, capped at the per-model
    `max_output_tokens` cap from :mod:`unread.ai.models` (or the 16k
    fallback for unknown models). The retry replaces the result — you
    don't get both. Cost is logged for both calls. Provider-agnostic:
    works the same for OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Google, and Local
    since each adapter's `truncated` flag is normalized to the same
    semantics.

    `disable_truncation_retry`: when True, never retry — surface the
    truncated response straight to the caller. Useful when the user
    explicitly opts out of the (potentially expensive) re-bill via
    `--no-truncation-retry`.

    exceptions like ``openai.AuthenticationError`` which don't tell them
