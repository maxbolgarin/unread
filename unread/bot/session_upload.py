"""`/upload_session` state machine.

Two states tracked on `app._chat_state[chat_id]`:
* ``pending_session_upload``: True after `/upload_session`; the next
  document from the owner is consumed here instead of routed to the
  file handler.
* (cleared after a successful install OR `/cancel`.)

Security: file mode is forced to 0o600 immediately after rename; the
validator opens the candidate as a Telethon `SQLiteSession`, runs
`is_user_authorized()`, and rejects anything that doesn't pass.
