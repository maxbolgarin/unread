"""Per-chat burst collector.

When the user pastes several links / drops several files in quick
succession, we don't want to ask `[▶ Run]` once per message. Instead,
each incoming analysis-shaped event is appended to a per-chat burst
and a short debounce timer is (re)started. When the quiet window
elapses, one consolidated panel is sent: `▶ Run separately` /
`▶ Run combined`. The user taps once and gets either N reports (one
per source) or a single merged report.

Only the analysis kinds — file / url / youtube / tg — bucket here.
Slash commands and session uploads keep their instant-reply path in
`app._handle`.
