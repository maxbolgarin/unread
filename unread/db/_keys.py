"""Shared allowlists for the on-disk SQLite key/value tables.

Three tables in `data.sqlite` are key/value-shaped and need to refuse rows
outside a controlled set:

* ``secrets`` — credentials. Surface outside this allowlist either lets a
  typo silently store a never-read value, or (worse) lets a manual
  ``sqlite INSERT`` smuggle in a credential that the read overlay then
  trusts.
* ``app_settings`` — config overrides applied at startup. Surface outside
  this allowlist gets persisted but ignored, which is confusing.
* ``bot_chat_settings`` — per-chat sticky bot settings. Same reasoning as
  ``app_settings``: a key nothing reads is dead weight.

Both lists used to be duplicated in :mod:`unread.secrets` and
:mod:`unread.db.repo`. They drifted at least once. Defining them here —
in a tiny module with no other imports — gives every reader (the wizard,
`put_secrets`, the legacy session-DB fallback, the sync bootstrap path,
the unit tests) a single source of truth.
