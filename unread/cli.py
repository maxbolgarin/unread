    Safe to run while unread is in the middle of a sync — SQLite makes the

    Restore with `unread backup restore <file>`.

    What the backup contains depends on the active credential-storage backend
    (see `unread security status`):

      • plain     — backup includes plaintext API keys + api_id / api_hash.
                    Treat the file like a password; anyone with it has your keys.
      • keystore  — backup does NOT include credentials. They live in the OS
                    keychain, which the backup can't see. Restoring on the same
                    machine still works (keychain is local). Restoring on a
                    different machine boots into a "no credentials" state and
                    you must re-run `unread init` to add keys.
      • pass      — backup includes ciphertext + the install salt + the
                    encrypted Telegram session. Restoring anywhere is fine, but
                    you'll need the passphrase to use it.
