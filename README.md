> A local CLI that turns Telegram chats, YouTube videos, web pages,
> and files into reports with citations — using whichever LLM
> you keep an API key for.

---

You have 47 unread Telegram groups. You will never read them.
You will now.

```bash
uv tool install unread && unread init
```
```bash
unread @somegroup --last-days 7
```

It pulls the chat, runs it through whichever LLM you keep an API key
for, and hands you a report with clickable citations back to
every claim. Same shape for YouTube videos, web pages, voice messages,
recorded meetings, podcasts, PDFs, and stdin. Or run it as a
self-hosted Telegram bot and forward anything weird at it — see
[Self-hosted Telegram bot](#self-hosted-telegram-bot) below.

![unread analyzing a Telegram channel into a Markdown report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxbolgarin/unread/main/.github/examples/analyze-example.gif)

## What it does

Three verbs. The same `<ref>` shape works on all of them.

- `unread <ref>` — **analyze**. Map-reduce the source into a Markdown report. Every claim links back to its message / paragraph / timestamp.
- `unread ask <ref> "Q"` — **ask**. One-shot Q&A with citations. Multi-turn follow-ups are one keystroke away.
- `unread dump <ref>` — **dump**. Save the original — chat history, transcript, article — verbatim. No LLM call.

`<ref>` is any of:

```bash
unread @somegroup --last-days 7              # Telegram chat / channel / forum
unread "https://youtu.be/jmzoJCn8evU"        # YouTube video (captions or Whisper)
unread "https://paulgraham.com/greatwork"    # Web page / article
unread ./meeting.mp3                         # Local file (PDF, DOCX, audio, video, image)
cat notes.txt | unread                       # Stdin
```

## Telegram in any language

This is the bit you actually want.

Use `unread tg` to analyze any yours chats with interactive picker.

Source language and report language are independent. The chat can be in
Russian, the report in English. Or English source → Spanish report. Or
anything → anything — the LLM does the heavy lifting and the source
hint is optional.

```bash
# Russian-language group, English summary
unread @forklog --last-days 7 --report-language en

# English channel, Russian summary
unread @thehackernews --last-days 14 --report-language ru
```

Out of the box, hand-tuned preset *structures* ship for `en` and `ru`
under [`presets/<lang>/*.md`](presets/) — section names, the forum
addendum, the report skeleton. For any other report language the LLM
writes the structure on the fly using the English preset as a template.
It works. It's not as polished as the native trees.

What you get back, for a Russian chat with `--report-language en`:

```markdown
## Decisions
- Migrate to indexed fund structures starting Q1 2026. [#1586](https://t.me/c/3865481227/584/1586)
- Drop the legacy K8s 1.27 cluster by end of month — Bob owns the rollout. [#1604](...)

## Open questions
- Who pays the OpenAI bill across the joint team? [#1612](...)
```

Every citation is a `t.me` link. Click → Telegram opens that message.

See [a real report](.github/examples/summary.md) from `@thehackernews` — 99 messages over two weeks, four chunks, $0.016, every bullet linked back to its source.

`unread` handles forums (topics), channel comments, voice notes
(transcribed), photos (described), forwarded media (deduped — Whisper
runs once across N chats), and your folder structure (`--folder Work`
batches everything in that Telegram folder). The full source-shape
matrix is in [`docs/sources.md`](docs/sources.md).

## YouTube — the bonus that pays for itself

`unread <youtube-url>` does the obvious thing: tries captions first,
falls back to Whisper if the video has none. Every citation in the
report becomes a `t=SECONDS` deep link, so clicking jumps you to that
moment of the video.

#### Analyze 30 mins of podcast:

```bash
unread https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmd6knanPKw 
```

#### Analyze a random old russian lecture with german report:

```bash
unread https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBEtiXnLtpw --report-language de
```

#### Ask a question about the video:

> from what timecode should i start watching if i want to know about RAG?

```bash
unread ask https://youtube.com/watch\?v\=k1njvbBmfsw "from what timecode should i start watching if i want to know about RAG?"
```

#### Save the transcript only:

```bash
unread dump https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDqvzFY72mg --mode=transcript
```

Cached after the first run. Re-asking a question about the same video
costs only the answer call — no yt-dlp, no Whisper, no re-spend.

Plain web pages (`unread <url>`), PDFs, DOCX, Markdown, audio, video,
and images all use the same `<ref>` syntax. See
[`docs/sources.md`](docs/sources.md) for the full list of supported
extensions and the cache rules.

## Voice, video, and any file — talk-to-text in one command

That 12-minute voice message someone sent you. The 45-minute meeting
recording you'll never play back. The hour-long lecture you wanted to
skim. Drop any of them in and get a Markdown summary:

```bash
unread ./meeting.mp3                 # audio → Whisper → summary
unread ./standup.mp4                 # video → ffmpeg → Whisper → summary
unread ./voice-note.ogg              # forwarded voice message saved to disk
unread ./report.pdf                  # PDF
unread ./screenshot.png              # image (vision)
```

Inside a Telegram chat the same step runs invisibly: voice notes and
video circles are transcribed, photos are described, the analysis
treats them as text. Forward a voice across five chats — Whisper runs
once, cached by Telegram's stable `document_id`.

Whisper is roughly $0.006 per minute of audio. A 30-minute podcast costs under twenty cents. Re-running on the same file is free when it hits the cache.

The full kind matrix and cache rules are in
[`docs/sources.md#media-enrichment`](docs/sources.md#media-enrichment).

## Bring your own model

Drop in a key for any of these. Switch at any time with
`unread settings` — caches and analyses persist across switches.

| Provider | What you get |
|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | Chat models + Whisper (audio) + embeddings + vision. The full toolkit. |
| **Anthropic** (Claude) | Chat models only. Pair with an OpenAI key if you also want voice / image enrichment. |
| **Google** (Gemini) | Chat models only. Same pairing note. |
| **OpenRouter** | One key, dozens of chat models — handy for trying Llama / DeepSeek / Mistral without separate signups. |
| **Local** (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM) | OpenAI-compatible HTTP. Zero cost, zero data leakage, your own model. |

Whisper / vision / embeddings are OpenAI-only. If you pick Anthropic or
Google as your chat provider and also want media enrichment, add an
OpenAI key alongside — `unread init` will offer it.

## Quickstart (90 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Install. uv handles the Python venv and binary.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh         # macOS / Linux
uv tool install unread

# 2. Interactive setup. Picks install folder, AI provider, Telegram (optional).
unread init

# 3. Run something.
unread "https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html"          # any web page
unread ./meeting.mp3                                    # any local file
unread @somegroup --last-days 7                         # last week of a chat
unread doctor                                           # confirm everything works
unread help                                           # show help
```

No virtualenv to activate, no `pip` conflicts, no global Python
pollution. Upgrade later with `uv tool upgrade unread`.

Skip the Telegram step if you only want YouTube / web / file analysis —
those work with only an AI key.

Full install matrix (Windows / ffmpeg / dev install / editable) is in
[`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md).

## Self-hosted Telegram bot

Run the same pipeline as a Telegram bot. Forward it a voice message
you don't feel like listening to, a PDF you don't feel like reading, a
YouTube link, a `t.me/...` post from a channel you're not sure you
want to subscribe to, or that suspicious link a friend just sent —
you get a Markdown summary back as a document, with cost and timing
in the caption.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxbolgarin/unread/main/.github/examples/bot.jpg" alt="Bot replying with a voice-message summary, attaching the PDF report" width="320">
</p>

Single-user by design: the bot only answers ONE Telegram ID. The
allowlist is auto-derived from the user session you give it (mounted
or sent via `/upload_session`); `UNREAD_BOT_OWNER_ID` is only a
bootstrap fallback for the case where no session is installed yet.
Everyone else is silently dropped.

Three install paths — pick by environment:

**1. Local laptop / dev** (`unread bot run` foreground):
```bash
uv tool install unread
export UNREAD_BOT_TOKEN=123:abc...   # from @BotFather
unread bot run
```

**2. Fresh Linux VM** — one line, blank disk to running systemd service:
```bash
UNREAD_EXECUTABLE="install-unread-bot.sh" && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxbolgarin/unread/main/scripts/install-bot.sh > $UNREAD_EXECUTABLE && chmod +x $UNREAD_EXECUTABLE && ./$UNREAD_EXECUTABLE && rm ./$UNREAD_EXECUTABLE
```
Installs uv + ffmpeg + libpango, runs `unread init`, asks for the
`@BotFather` token, drops a `systemd --user` unit that auto-restarts
on crash and survives SSH disconnect.

**3. Docker** — pull the generic `unread` image from GHCR (same image
can also run one-off CLI commands; `command: ["unread","bot","run"]`
in the compose file specifies the bot mode):
```bash
cp .env.bot.example .env.bot && $EDITOR .env.bot
docker compose -f docker-compose.bot.yml --env-file .env.bot up -d
```

Reports default to PDF; set `UNREAD_BOT_REPORT_FORMAT=md` in `.env.bot`
to skip PDF rendering (`.md` upload instead). The first time you
message the bot with a `t.me/...` link it'll ask for `/upload_session`
— send your laptop's `~/.unread/storage/session.sqlite` as a Telegram
document and it's ready.

Full feature reference (slash commands, the confirm panel, what each
input kind does) is in [`docs/bot.md`](docs/bot.md). End-to-end VM
deployment guide covering all three paths is in
[`docs/bot-vm-deploy.md`](docs/bot-vm-deploy.md).


## Why this exists

I have ~50 Telegram groups I genuinely want to follow and not enough
hours to read them. The same is true for the videos I bookmark and the
articles I save to "read later." LLMs are now cheap enough that
analyzing a week of group chat costs less than a coffee. My time is
not. So I built the CLI I wanted to use — local-first, citation-backed,
provider-agnostic — and now I open Telegram a lot less.

## The boring but real bits

- **Local-first.** SQLite under `~/.unread/`. Your messages, embeddings, analyses, and secrets stay on your disk. The only network calls are to Telegram, your chosen AI provider, and any URLs you point at.
- **Security.** Your API keys, Telegram session, and other secrets can be encrypted at rest. You can use your OS keychain (default) or passphrase to unlock the CLI.
- **Citations on every claim.** Reports link back to the source message / paragraph / timestamp. `--cite-context N` expands citations into `<details>` blocks with surrounding context, so the report is auditable without re-opening Telegram.
- **Two-layer cache.** Local analysis cache (re-running an unchanged chat is free) + the AI provider's prompt cache (server-side discount on repeated prefixes). `unread cache stats` shows the hit rate.
- **Cost guardrails.** `--max-cost 0.50` aborts or confirms before you spend more than that. `--dry-run` estimates without calling the model. `unread stats` shows lifetime spend by chat / preset / day.
- **PII redaction.** `--redact` scrubs phones, emails, IBANs, and Luhn-valid card numbers from what gets sent to the LLM. Originals stay in the local DB.
- **Map-reduce, automatic.** Big histories get chunked, summarized in parallel, then merged. Each chunk is cached independently — adding one message to the tail re-costs only the last chunk.
- **Forums, channels with comments, folders.** Telegram's awkward shapes are first-class. `--all-per-topic`, `--with-comments`, `--folder Work`.

Encryption modes (`keystore`, passphrase-derived `pass`), session
hygiene, and the threat model are documented in
[`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md).

## FAQ

**Does this ship my Telegram history to OpenAI?**
Only the messages in the window you asked about, only after PII
redaction if you set `--redact`, and only to the provider whose key you
configured. Nothing else leaves the machine. The local cache is in
your install dir; you can wipe it any time with `unread cache ai purge`.

**What if I don't use Telegram?**
Skip `unread init`'s Telegram step. `unread <url>` and `unread <file>`
work with only an AI key. Most of the codebase is source-agnostic.

**What languages does it actually support?**
Source content: anything Whisper auto-detects (audio) or your LLM can
read (text) — pretty much everything human languages cover. Reports:
anything your LLM can write. EN and RU get hand-tuned preset
structures; other report languages use the English preset as a
template that the LLM translates on the fly.

**Will it cost me money?**
Yes — your AI provider charges. `unread` itself is free. Per-call USD
is logged; `--max-cost N` caps a single run. Re-running an unchanged
chat is free (local cache hit). With cheap models (`gpt-5.4-mini`-class,
Gemini Flash, Claude Haiku) the bill is small enough that most users
stop reading the cost reports after a week.

**Is it actually fast?**
Fast enough that I stopped reading group chats. No benchmark table —
speed depends on chat size, model choice, and your network. Try it
with `unread @somegroup --last-days 1 --dry-run` to see the estimate
before any LLM call.

**Can I run it on a server / in cron?**
Yes. Non-TTY mode skips interactive prompts. `unread watch --interval 1h ...`
loops in the foreground (run under tmux / systemd / nohup). API keys
can come from env vars or `~/.unread/.env`. The passphrase backend
reads `UNREAD_PASSPHRASE` for headless unlock.

**Can I plug in my own preset / prompt?**
`--preset custom --prompt-file my-prompt.md`. Same frontmatter format
as the bundled ones in [`presets/`](presets/). Bump `prompt_version`
in the frontmatter when you edit, otherwise the cache won't notice.
