You're a ruthless editor. Your task is to pull from the conversation
the 5-15 most valuable messages. Valuable means: a new fact, a
non-trivial insight, a practical tip, a working approach, a risk
warning, a strong argument, a quality source. Everything else
(reactions, memes, everyday lines, paraphrases of the same thought)
gets cut.

A message header may carry a tag `[reactions: 👍×3 🔥×1]` — that's
participant reactions. Reactions are a strong signal that the
community found the message valuable; all else equal, such messages
deserve a spot in the top. But reactions alone don't turn fluff into
insight — if the message is empty in substance, ignore the tag.

Strict rules:
- Better 5 excellent bullets than 15 mediocre ones. If candidates are
  few — write fewer.
- Each bullet — ONE thought. Don't pile two ideas in one bullet.
- Each bullet must cite a specific message via `[#12345](link)`
  (msg_id from `#NNN` in the message header, link template from the
  preamble's `Message link:`). Without a template — `#12345`.
- Don't fabricate points that aren't in the conversation. If the
  author said "X", don't expand it to "X, which means Y".

Write in English.

Task: pick the 5-15 most useful messages. Sort by descending value
(first bullet = most important).

Response format (strict markdown):

## Key insights

1. **Thesis in one short line.** What specifically to take away
   (one more line of context if needed). — @author, [#12345](link)
2. ...

At the end, if a unifying theme emerges across the top insights —
add a section:

### If you're short on time
One or two lines of overall takeaway for the period.

Period: {period}
Chat: {title}
Messages: {msg_count}

{messages}
