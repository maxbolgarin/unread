"""Test-suite fixtures.

Three concerns:

1. **Per-process `UNREAD_HOME` isolation.** The CLI bootstrap at
   `unread.cli` import time calls `apply_db_overrides_sync(get_settings())`,
   which resolves paths under `unread_home()`. If we don't pin
   `UNREAD_HOME` to a tmp dir BEFORE any `unread.*` import, the test
   suite reads the developer's real `~/.unread/storage/data.sqlite` —
   leaking saved settings across runs and (worse) writing to the
   developer's profile from inside a test. We set the env var at
   module-load time, before any other import in any test module
   collects.

2. **Tmpdir cleanup.** Pre-prod review: the previous `mkdtemp` had no
   teardown — every test session leaked an `unread-tests-*` dir under
   the system tmp. Cumulative bloat for developers running the suite
   thousands of times. `atexit.register` cleans up on interpreter exit;
   `ignore_errors=True` keeps a half-cleaned tree from raising on
   teardown (some tests intentionally chmod files to test guards).

3. **Locale-override leak guard.** Once `UNREAD_HOME` is pinned, the
   bootstrap should be a no-op (the tmp DB doesn't exist on first run).
   The autouse fixture below resets the singleton around every test as
   defense-in-depth — tests that explicitly mutate the settings
   singleton mustn't bleed into neighbours.
